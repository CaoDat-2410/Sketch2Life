# FEAT-018 live image and canvas context

- Status: APPROVED for P1 slice; downstream ExperienceSpec consumers remain pending approval
- Plan revision: 2 (P1 slice approved; downstream consumers pending approval)
- Owner: shared integration allocation pending contract freeze approval
- Goal: run a non-sensitive real JPG/PNG through validation, backend-only Qwen3-VL understanding, Gate A, one-anchor/one-objective ExperienceSpec compilation, P1/Gate B, PixiJS canvas, P4 cache/fallback, off-screen handoff, gallery journey and feedback.
- Data policy: non-sensitive test image only; no child/personal data, production data, or provider credential in Git/mobile/evidence.
- Dependencies: FEAT-003 understanding contracts, FEAT-015 fixture contracts, FEAT-016 runtime/session contracts, FEAT-017 live Lightning development path, FEAT-004 PixiJS/GSAP renderer plan, ADR-0006 allocation rules.
- Contract authority: `plan/CONTRACT_FREEZE.md`.
- Pilot: 20 golden activities for full device/integration flow; 100 MVP activities for offline catalog/reference validation.

## Current state

P2 research round 1 is complete as documentation only (2026-09-09). Working research
and handoff notes remain local-only; publish selected completed P2 records after
owner review through the evidence index. See
`plan/P2_OFFLINE_FIRST_PLAN.md` (P2-R1, awaiting owner review). The proposal separates
offline work from later FEAT-003 producer connections and full live acceptance.
The owner reports Phase 8 executed with insufficient quality. A new untracked Phase 8
report appeared during final verification and records `QUALITY_NOT_READY`, with both
passes schema-valid 8/8 but below quality thresholds; its hash and provenance are in
the local research report. No FEAT-003 state, report or approval was changed by this research.

The repository has a fixture UI and backend-only live P2 route. The approved P1 slice is now implemented offline: the reviewed catalog is loaded through a typed template adapter, adult context and hard eligibility rules run before fit scoring, and the fixture-only ExperienceSpec compiler locks anchor/objective/template/spec identity at Gate B. PixiJS/GSAP runtime/bridge, approved asset pack, live media consumers and gallery journey remain downstream work and are still pending their own approval.

## P2 image admission (D1) — 2026-09-10

An isolated image admission and decoding design was accepted and published
(`evidence/P2_IMAGE_DECODE_DESIGN_20260910.md`, `EV-018-P2-DECODE-DESIGN-01`), conditional on
preserving the existing FEAT-003 image-research path. The follow-on D1 specification is now
complete and published as revision 2 (`evidence/P2_IMAGE_ADMISSION_SPEC_20260910.md`,
`EV-018-P2-D1-SPEC-01`): exact admission outcomes, bounded snapshot flow, a measured PyAV
decoder profile, a FEAT-018-local fixture manifest design, and an implementation acceptance
checklist. **Implementation (D2) is NOT_STARTED.** This is a specification, not an
implementation approval, and does not amend `approvals/TASK_APPROVAL.md`. One decision (U1:
declaring `av==18.1.0` in a new optional `image-admission` extra in `backend/pyproject.toml`)
still requires explicit owner approval before D2 work, followed by a recorded D2 task approval.
The specification is additive to FEAT-018 and changes no FEAT-003 default, validator,
inspector, contract, policy, prompt, model profile, fixture, scoring rule, benchmark runner or
historical evidence.
