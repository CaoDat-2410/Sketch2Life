# FEAT-018 live image and canvas context

- Status: APPROVED for P1 slice; downstream ExperienceSpec consumers remain pending approval
- Plan revision: 2 (P1 slice approved; downstream consumers pending approval)
- Owner: shared integration allocation pending contract freeze approval
- Goal: run a non-sensitive real JPG/PNG through validation, backend-only Qwen3-VL understanding, Gate A, one-anchor/one-objective ExperienceSpec compilation, P1/Gate B, PixiJS canvas, P4 cache/fallback, off-screen handoff, gallery journey and feedback.
- Data policy: non-sensitive test image only; no child/personal data, production data, or provider credential in Git/mobile/evidence.
- Dependencies: FEAT-003 understanding contracts, FEAT-015 fixture contracts, FEAT-016 runtime/session contracts, FEAT-017 live Lightning development path, FEAT-004 PixiJS/GSAP renderer plan, ADR-0006 allocation rules.
- Contract authority: `plan/CONTRACT_FREEZE.md`.
- Pilot: 20 golden activities for full device/integration flow; 100 MVP activities for offline catalog/reference validation.

## Current state

The repository has a fixture UI and backend-only live P2 route. The approved P1 slice is now implemented offline: the reviewed catalog is loaded through a typed template adapter, adult context and hard eligibility rules run before fit scoring, and the fixture-only ExperienceSpec compiler locks anchor/objective/template/spec identity at Gate B. PixiJS/GSAP runtime/bridge, approved asset pack, live media consumers and gallery journey remain downstream work and are still pending their own approval.
