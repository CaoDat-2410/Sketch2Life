# Task approval — FEAT-066 School Manager web remediation and flow guide

- Status: `APPROVED_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION`
- Approver: User, direct School Manager web authorization plus follow-up logout issue report and request for a sequential SRS v2.7 School Manager flow guide in chat on 2026-11-10 (Asia/Bangkok).
- Approved scope: FEAT-066 plan revision 6; modify only `apps/school-manager-ui` and FEAT-066 governance/evidence in worktree `F:/Github/Sketch2Life-worktrees/fe-ui-web-remediation`, branch `codex/fe-ui-web-remediation`.
- Plan revision: 6
- Plan SHA-256: `25E24871660A892C3380A359EA5285C6148B4C47FC75248C35D71FAC303231C9`
- Product requirements: canonical FEAT-063 SRS v2.7-draft Rev57, verified SHA-256 `BE0D656966FDE91BA7CD5C914C319EF301D137985EF5CC91B94F36FEBCF61FB5`; still a draft awaiting formal owner sign-off. This task approval does not sign off the SRS.

## Approved work

- Complete revision 4 remediation and add a visible, keyboard-accessible logout action on authenticated School Manager pages by reusing the existing `logout` handler. Verify it clears current session state and returns to `/login`; do not add auth policy, backend, or provider behavior.
- Inspect existing API/contracts for the School Manager flows named in the plan. Implement a flow only when a compatible contract already exists; otherwise show a clear unavailable state and record the missing dependency in FEAT-066 evidence.
- Produce a sequential School Manager web flow test guide sourced from canonical SRS v2.7 and checked API/contracts. For every flow, identify SRS references, current route or missing route, API support, safe test steps, expected result, and known blockers. Distinguish target behavior from current FE-only state; do not use §32 snapshots or infer open commercial policy.
- Run the local School Manager preview bound to loopback, manually inspect the requested routes at desktop and 390px, and save traceable before/after screenshots under FEAT-066 evidence.
- Update FEAT-066 context, decisions, evidence, and status as the work progresses.

## Conditions and exclusions

- Parent mobile/UI, Teacher, Admin/Platform Admin, backend, contracts, providers, production services/data, credentials, and real user/child data are excluded.
- Do not invent data, successful transactions, prices, billing policy, subscription policy, or quota-commercial policy. Keep School Manager child-media access denied by default.
- Do not run or add automated tests/builds unless separately requested. Repository security validation is required before commit/push.
- The previous revision 3 read-only audit approval is superseded for this implementation scope only; its audit/evidence remains historical and unchanged.

Revision 5 added the user-reported logout control; its approved plan hash was `D90C628F1A8283E59582256CB8ED656C8E69C6C27A520D827C1BAD7CB42FEE53`. Revision 6 adds only the requested FEAT-066 flow-test guide. This revision 6 approval and plan hash are recorded before writing the guide. Revision 4 plan hash was `D9780223AB395C1B5A9942F4011B749A2A15E3D66283A178F768AF9E9AC0CCB6`.
