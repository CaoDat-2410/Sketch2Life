# Task approvals

## FEAT-063 ? Qwen3.5-only profile and FLUX.3 component retest

- **Status:** APPROVED / COMPLETE.
- **Approved by:** Project owner, by direct instruction in the active conversation.
- **Approval timestamp:** 2026-11-05 22:58:08 Asia/Saigon.
- **Feature:** FEAT-063 ? system architecture rearchitecture.
- **Plans:**
  - `features/FEAT-063-system-architecture-rearchitecture/plan/PLAN_REV46_QWEN35_ONLY_FLUX_SECRET_RETEST_20261105.md` ? approved SHA-256 `4F796831148D134B2EABB1CBF791AE1D41C341C9D0C736BED4ECCDC11632B51F`; execution closeout SHA-256 `9dc252d80ce46aeddb9eca1c10da6ad60e52c11907441cea2a3c426ecd324f8f`.
  - `features/FEAT-063-system-architecture-rearchitecture/plan/PLAN_REV46A_FLUX_COMPONENT_FILES_AND_FAILED_FLOW_RETEST_20261105.md` ? approved SHA-256 `334ACE80E495EFD453BED980F78F5F9767ADD98C2F32617BCAD8DB87B74C2AE8`; execution closeout SHA-256 `ab24410c6d4b3bcc69cb9acbaf9d58bf7b7ff5bcd6e6785ddb126b8ce375434e`.
- **Owner's direct model instruction:** ?x?a b?t qwen 2 ra ?i, d?ng qwen 3.5 th?i?.
- **Approved scope:** retire Qwen2.5 from active FEAT-063 model configuration and use only pinned `Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B` for active Qwen development workloads; preserve historical records. Fix FLUX.3 Diffusers component staging and run one checkpoint download plus one synthetic inference for each Rev46-terminal-failed image workload, using the existing Modal `dev` Secret without reading its value.
- **Acceptance criteria:** active Qwen workloads resolve only to the pinned Qwen3.5 model; FLUX checkpoint verifier requires transformer and VAE files and does not skip incomplete checkpoints because of an existing marker; the two failed image workloads each receive at most one post-fix attempt; output contracts or exact terminal failures are recorded; task-owned Modal app stops with zero tasks; no video, production enablement, real child data, destructive volume action, commit, or push.
- **Execution boundaries:** follow the two approved FEAT-063 plans and keep evidence in that feature's evidence directory. The feature-level plan and approval records remain canonical for detailed per-plan execution history.


## FEAT-063 Plan Rev50 ? local dev duplicate repair, Modal AI integration, and SRS authority

- **Status:** APPROVED / IN PROGRESS for the exact scope in Plan Rev50.
- **Approver:** Project owner, direct instruction on 2026-11-06 to fix duplicated `dev` commits without changing commit names; selected the full Modal AI branch and pending AI changes. The owner?s prior instruction to keep the newest FEAT-063 SRS canonical is also preserved.
- **Recorded timestamp:** 2026-11-06 06:13:08 Asia/Saigon.
- **Feature:** FEAT-063 ? system architecture rearchitecture.
- **Approved plan:** `features/FEAT-063-system-architecture-rearchitecture/plan/PLAN_REV50_DEV_DUPLICATE_REPAIR_AND_MODAL_AI_INTEGRATION_20261106.md`.
- **Plan SHA-256:** `404B793E8A00438882A8CC0532013EC5CD7BB188577EF35713A73DC5EF696936`.
- **Scope:** retain a backup of the current dirty checkout; reset only the local `dev` ref to `origin/dev` to remove six patch-equivalent local copies; commit the 269 manifested pending Modal changes (excluding retained pytest scratch directories); integrate the full Modal branch and the published FEAT-063 SRS v2.4 branch while preserving all existing commit objects/messages; record evidence and run the required repository security validator.
- **Acceptance criteria:** AC50.1?AC50.7 in the hash-identified plan.
- **Exclusions:** no push, force push, remote history rewrite, rebase, amend, squash, commit-message change, tests or provider calls, cleanup of the scratch directories, or modification of unrelated dirty checkout content.
- **Approval basis:** direct owner instructions in the current and preceding conversation; this record authorizes only the exact plan scope above.
